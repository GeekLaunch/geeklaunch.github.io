      <description>(This article got a shout-out in Matt Parker&amp;rsquo;s follow-up video. Did you know I also make YouTube videos?)
Matt Parker of Stand Up Maths recently uploaded a video entitled &amp;ldquo;Can you find: five five-letter words with twenty-five unique letters?,&amp;rdquo; which I highly recommend you watch to understand the point of this post, the problem we&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve, and the algorithm we&amp;rsquo;ll be optimizing.
In the video, he mentions that the Python code he wrote to solve the &amp;ldquo;five five-letter words with twenty-five unique letters&amp;rdquo; problem (or the &amp;ldquo;5-5-25&amp;rdquo; problem, for short) took 2,760,670.</description>

      <title>The State of Web3 in 2022</title>

      <description>There are a lot of issues that web3 needs to address, and fast.
I recently attended CoinDesk Consensus 2022, and I talked to a lot of people there. The goal of this document is to answer the most common questions and address the most common themes that arose from these conversations.
Innovation transcends regulation The crypto ecosystem flails around a lot, and even as someone who works within the industry, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to see where it&amp;rsquo;s going as a whole: the web3 world quickly transitioned from its L1 launch and ICO heyday, to the NFT craze, to the liquidity farming frenzy.</description>

      <title>Storage Locations in Ethereum vs. NEAR</title>

      <description>The keywords memory, storage, calldata are a big pain point for new Solidity developers—just look at the sheer number of questions that have been asked and articles that have been written 1 2 3 4 about the topic, not to mention the multiple, different, sections (and here, and here) the Solidity documentation dedicates to the topic.
Storage locations in Solidity are no joke!
I hope to accomplish two things in this write-up:</description>

      <description>Check out the new Compulang podcast from GeekLaunch on Anchor and Spotify.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering the latest, greatest, and weirdest of tech and international news. There will also be a video version uploaded to the GeekLaunch YouTube channel with extra visuals.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to start a podcast for quite a while now, and I finally had the impetus, inspiration, and time to do it. Right now the plan is to release one episode per week, sometime over the weekend.</description>

      <description>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be awesome to see that little &amp;ldquo;Verified&amp;rdquo; badge next to your GitHub organization&amp;rsquo;s name? (See what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about here.)
If you&amp;rsquo;re new to domain name wrangling and DNS might as well stand for Desoxyribonukleinsäure, this is a perfect place to start.
Make sure you have these things before we get started:
An organization on GitHub A domain name you&amp;rsquo;d like to associate with that organization You must have access to the DNS records for the domain name.</description>

      <description>I am passionate about educating others about technology and programming. In the past, I have given talks about programming, cryptocurrency trading, and smart contract development at universities, non-profits, cryptocurrency &amp;amp; startup conferences, and meetups, both in-person and remotely. I also developed and taught a course on smart contract programming and periodically record educational videos on YouTube.
I am active as a professional tech mentor, having tutored over 100 individuals online and in-person in various topic of programming, computer science theory, and distributed ledger technology.</description>
