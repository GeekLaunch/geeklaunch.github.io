I am passionate about educating others about technology and programming. In the past, I have given talks about programming, cryptocurrency trading, and smart contract development at universities, non-profits, cryptocurrency & startup conferences, and meetups, both in-person and remotely. I also developed and taught [a course on smart contract programming](https://web3.courses/) and periodically record [educational videos on YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/GeekLaunch).

I am active as a professional tech mentor, having tutored over 100 individuals online and in-person in various topic of programming, computer science theory, and distributed ledger technology. If you are interested in mentoring or startup advising, please do not hesitate to reach out.

My professional software engineering experience includes two medical software companies (a [Canon Medical](https://us.medical.canon/) subsidiary, [Procentive](https://procentive.com/)), [a _Fortune 500_ company](https://corporate.target.com/), [a Layer-1 cryptocurrency protocol](https://near.org), multiple non-profits ([NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation), [Blockchain Acceleration Foundation](https://blockchainacceleration.org), [Algorand Foundation](https://www.algorand.foundation/)), as well as [over 100 individuals](https://www.codementor.io/@encody).

I'm experienced with many technologies and programming languages, including:
