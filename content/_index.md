# GeekLaunch

> _Not a geek? Start today!_

GeekLaunch produces free educational web development videos covering a variety of topics, including CSS, JavaScript (including TypeScript and Node.JS), PHP, Linux, Rust, and more!

GeekLaunch was created and is managed by me, Jacob. I love teaching others how computers and software work, and GeekLaunch has given me a way to share that love with the world.

I have produced over 100 videos for the [GeekLaunch YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GeekLaunch?sub_confirmation=1) since it started in October 2015. The source code to many of the videos is on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeekLaunch). Check out [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Geek_Launch), too.
