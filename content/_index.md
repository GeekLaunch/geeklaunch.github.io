            GeekLaunch was created and is managed by me, Jacob. I love teaching others how computers and software work, and GeekLaunch has given me a way to share that love with the world.

            I have produced over 100 videos for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GeekLaunch?sub_confirmation=1">GeekLaunch YouTube channel</a> since it started in October 2015. The source code to many of the videos is on <a href="https://github.com/GeekLaunch">GitHub</a>. Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/Geek_Launch">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/GeekLaunch">Patreon</a>, too.
