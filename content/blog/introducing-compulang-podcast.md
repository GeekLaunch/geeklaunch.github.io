Check out the new Compulang podcast from GeekLaunch on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/compulang) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1dbAiohaRGky49dv6mdgbH?si=caffaVkVSj66eAozAlqDzA).

I'll be covering the latest, greatest, and weirdest of tech and international news. There will also be a video version uploaded to the [GeekLaunch YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/GeekLaunch?sub_confirmation=1) with extra visuals.

I've been wanting to start a podcast for quite a while now, and I finally had the impetus, inspiration, and time to do it. Right now the plan is to release one episode per week, sometime over the weekend.

Anchor offers a really interesting way for you to interact with the podcast via submitting voice messages. If you want to submit a voice message, I encourage you to do so, and I look forward to hearing from you!

This will also be a fun venture for me into finally getting around to learning the Adobe software suite. Until this point I've almost exclusively used free and open-source software, but as my need for efficiency and effectiveness in media production grows, I've decided to experiment beyond open-source.

All of this to say, I'm starting a podcast and I'd love for you to give it a listen.

Cheers!
