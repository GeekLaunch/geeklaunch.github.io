    <h2>Free Desktop Wallpaper!</h2>
    <p>Hey everybody! I&#39;ve been experimenting with a bit of graphic design stuff in my free time. One of my most recent projects is a 4K (3840x2160) wallpaper I call <em>Planetary Collision</em>.</p>
    <p>I made it 100% from scratch in a free program called <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, including each and every planet, as well as the lighting effects, etc.</p>
    <p>You can download the wallpaper <a href="/img/planetary-collision-3840x2160.jpg" download data-ajax-handler="false">here (3840x2160)</a> or <a href="/img/planetary-collision-1920x1080.jpg" download data-ajax-handler="false">here (1920x1080)</a> or right click on the image below and select &quot;Save as...&quot;.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="/img/planetary-collision-1920x1080.jpg" alt="Planetary collision" title="1920x1080 resolution" style="max-width:60vw">
