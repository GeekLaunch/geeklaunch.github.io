    <h2>Welcome to the new website!</h2>
    <p>
        Oh yeah, folks! This is it! The new website.
    </p>
    <p>
        I&apos;ve been wanting to get GeekLaunch a website for a while, and it&apos;s finally here! All right! So, what does it have to offer?
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="/">about</a> section is a simple overview of what GeekLaunch is and does.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the <a href="/web-development">web development</a> section you can get my contact info if you want me to design you a custom website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>This</strong> is the <a href="/blog">blog</a>. For now, the blog will contain updates and random other goodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPXyziOUs7oglOtmCPhFSKQ?sub_confirmation=1">Here&apos;s the link to the YouTube channel</a>. That&apos;s where all of the videos are uploaded. <code>:)</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/GeekLaunch">GitHub account</a> is where all of the code is uploaded. Check it out and star your favorite projects!
    </p>
    <p>
        I started a <a href="https://twitter.com/Geek_Launch">Twitter</a>! Don&apos;t be shy about following!

    <h2>Patreon</h2>
    <p>
        Yup, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/GeekLaunch">I started a Patreon</a>. What&apos;s Patreon? Good question.
    </p>
    <p>
        Patreon allows content creators (like me) to be supported financially by their fans (like you). When you decide to support me on Patreon, you&apos;re deciding to pitch in and help me produce even more, quality content for you!
