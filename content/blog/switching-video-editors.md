    <h2>I&apos;m switching video editors.</h2>
    <p>
        Yep. You read that right. Actually, I&apos;m not switching video editors right <em>now</em>, it&apos;s already happened.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://kdenlive.org/">Kdenlive</a> had been my video editor since I started GeekLaunch. It had all the features I felt I needed, as a beginning YouTuber/video editor. Recently, however, it had been giving me problems with keyframes/effects and rendering, so I decided it was time to switch. The last video I edited with Kdenlive was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELxmUJZhyV8">AJAX Page Loader (Part 1)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The editor I&apos;m using now has much better support for keyframes and the effects I need, and, though it definitely doesn&apos;t render faster, I think it&apos;s a better choice for me than Kdenlive was.
    </p>
    <p>
        It&apos;s not OpenShot, or Cinelerra, or Lightworks, or Flowblade, or Pitivi, or Avidemux, or Shotcut... In fact, it&apos;s not even on <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/kdenlive/?platform=linux">this list</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        What&apos;s this video editor I&apos;m talking about?

        Funnily enough, Blender is mainly, actually, a 3D editor. It also happens to contain an amazingly fast video editor, called the Video Sequence Editor (VSE).
    </p>
    <p>
        Blender was used to make movies such as <a href="https://peach.blender.org/">Big Buck Bunny</a>, <a href="https://mango.blender.org/">Tears of Steel</a>, and <a href="https://durian.blender.org/">Sintel</a>, and it&apos;s now my main video editor. (Of course, I couldn&apos;t resist tinkering with 3D modeling as well!) The central reason I wanted to switch to Blender as a video editor stemmed from my desire to animate the outro of my videos, as you can see at the end the latest release from GeekLaunch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBlgCQi5vGU">AJAX Page Loader (Part 2)</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Ideally, Blender will stay my video editor for quite a long time, as I would love to learn more about this amazing program and the myriad of features it offers. I might even get serious about 3D modeling. Hey&mdash;you never know!
